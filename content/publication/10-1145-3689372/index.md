abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has exacerbated
  the challenges of misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information (MDM) within
  digital ecosystems. These multi-faceted challenges demand a re-evaluation of the
  digital information lifecycle and a deep understanding of its social impact. An
  interdisciplinary strategy integrating insights from technology, social sciences,
  and policy analysis is crucial to address these issues effectively. This article
  introduces a three-tiered framework to scrutinize the lifecycle of GenAI-driven
  content from creation to consumption, emphasizing the consumer perspective. We examine
  the dynamics of consumer behavior that drive interactions with MDM, pinpoints vulnerabilities
  in the information dissemination process, and advocates for adaptive, evidence-based
  policies. Our interdisciplinary methodology aims to bolster information integrity
  and fortify public trust, equipping digital societies to manage the complexities
  of GenAI and proactively address the evolving challenges of digital misinformation.
  We conclude by discussing how GenAI can be leveraged to combat MDM, thereby creating
  a reflective cycle of technological advancement and mitigation.
