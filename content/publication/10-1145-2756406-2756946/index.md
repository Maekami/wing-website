abstract: We address the tasks of recovering bibliographic and document structure
  metadata from scholarly documents. We leverage higher order semi-Markov conditional
  random fields to model long-distance label sequences, improving upon the performance
  of the linear-chain conditional random field model. We introduce the notion of extensible
  features, which allows the expensive inference process to be simplified through
  memoization, resulting in lower computational complexity. Our method significantly
  betters the state-of-the-art on three related scholarly document extraction tasks.
