abstract: We systematically confirm that instructors are strongly influenced by the
  user interface presentation of Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) discussion forums.
  In a large scale dataset, we conclusively show that instructor interventions exhibit
  strong position bias, as measured by the position where the thread appeared on the
  user interface at the time of intervention. We measure and remove this bias, enabling
  unbiased statistical modelling and evaluation. We show that our de-biased classifier
  improves predicting interventions over the state-of-the-art on courses with sufficient
  number of interventions by 8.2% in F1 and 24.4% in recall on average.
