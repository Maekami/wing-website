summary: 'The 2024 Singapore Symposium on Natural Language Processing'
abstract: 'We are excited to announce that the Singapore Symposium on Natural Language Processing (SSNLP 2024) will take place on Wednesday, November 6, as a full-day event. SSNLP, an annual pre-conference workshop, gathers the Natural Language Processing community in Singapore, bringing together local students, practitioners, and faculty. It offers a valuable platform to connect, exchange ideas, and foster collaboration.

Since its inception in 2018, SSNLP has steadily grown in both popularity and influence, with successful editions held in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023. We look forward to continuing this tradition in 2024 and delivering another impactful experience for all participants.'
